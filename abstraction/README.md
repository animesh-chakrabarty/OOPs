## Abstract class
- The abstract class in java cannot be instantiated (we can't create objects of abstract calsses)

## Abstract method
- A method that doesn't have a body is known as abstract method

- abstract class can have both regular and abstract methods
- An abstract class can only be used by creating a subclass
- If the abstract class includes any abstract method, then all the child classes inherited from the abstract superclass must provide the implementation of the abstract method

## Interface
- An interface is a fully abstract calss. It includes a group of abstract methods
- implements keyword is used to implement an interface
- interfaces are used to achieve multiple inheritance in java

_IMP: All methods inside an interface are implicitly public and all fields are implicitly public static final_

## Inner class 

## Nested static class

## Anonymous class

## Functional interfaces

## Lambda expression
