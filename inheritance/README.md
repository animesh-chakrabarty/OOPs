# Inheritance

- Inheritance allows us to create a new class from an existing class.
- The new class that is created is known as sub class/ child class.
- The existing class from where the child class is derived is known as base class/ parent class.

## Method Overriding
- If a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared by one of its parent class, it is known as method overriding (runtime polymorphism).
