# Inheritance

- Inheritance allows us to create a new class from an existing class.
- The new class that is created is known as sub class/ child class.
- The existing class from where the child class is derived is known as base class/ parent class.

## super Keyword

- super keyword is used to access the instance variable (super.propertyName), methods (super.methodName()) & constructors (super()) of immediate parent class

_IMP: when any contstructor of the child class is invoked the default constructor of the parent class will also be invoked automatically_
